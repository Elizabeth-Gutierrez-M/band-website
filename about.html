        Pepe Aguilar was born into a musical family. His father, Antonio
        Aguilar, was an iconic regional Mexican singer who sold over 25 million
        records and is credited with being one of the pioneers in bringing
        charro and mariachi culture to international audiences. His mother, Flor
        Silvestre, was also an iconic regional Mexican singer and was one of the
        leading ladies in what is considered the golden era of Mexican cinema.
        He is the nephew of singers La Prieta Linda and Mary Jiménez, his
        mother’s younger sisters. He has four siblings: Antonio Aguilar Jr.,
        Dalia Inés, Francisco Rubiales, and Marcela Rubiales. He married Aneliz
        Álvarez Alcalá, who at one point was kidnapped along with his brother
        and held for ransom. He has four children with Leonardo Aguilar and
        Ángela Aguilar also being singers. <br />

        Like a businessman and artist who is independent, he has his own record
        label (Equinoccio Records) and studio with the highest technology in
        Latin America. He has also gone to the movement of fashion. In 2009 he
        took out his own fashion line called "Pepe Aguilar Línea de Calzado,"
        which debuted for men and women. To celebrate this and share yet another
        aspect of his life with his fans, he launched his "Pepe Aguilar
        Signature Collection" through WSS Warehouse Shoe Sale retailer in the
        United States. In addition, his dream of helping Mexico in some way has
        given way to an eco-friendly agricultural project in which Aguilar will
        strengthen and promote the organic production of crops in communities in
        Zacatecas, using traditional practices and technology that will have a
        positive impact on the environment.
